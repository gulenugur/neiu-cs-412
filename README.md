# Puppy Paw

## Summary

Puppy Paw was developed mainly for dog owners and dog walkers. The owners’ section of the application is intended to be their convenience. Since it’s a minimum viable product all functionality was demoed on the park section of the application where users are able to find a list of parks and are able to add new parks that are not listed, edit an existing park, delete a park, view information of this park and update their profiles. In order to use all these functionalities, users must register and login to the application. When users want to register, they need to fill out a simple registration form with their name, their dog’s breed, and age, email, and password. The reason dog breed and age are included in the registration form is that when the hospital, groomers, and hotel section of the application is created in the future these will be shared with these businesses when users make an appointment with them so they will know what kind of dog they will have in advance. After registration, users can log in with their email and password they created. In addition to the functionalities listed above users also able to see walkers and search walkers. Walkers are another type of user of this application, but they are not able to do as much as regular users do. Walkers can register under the walker tab with their personal information, their preferred location and time to work, and their contact information. After signing up they will be listed on the walker list by their location and availability. When users click on the walker in the list, they can see detailed information about that walker.

The application was developed using the following technologies: Node JS, MongoDB, and Express. Additionally, third-party libraries were used such as passport, mongoose, express-validator, bootstrap.

## Future Work

Since it is a minimum viable product, only the park and walker components of the application were created. In the future pet shops, hotels/shelters, groomers, training centers, vets/hospitals sections will be developed. Also, another type of user which is a business owner will be inserted so business owners and dog owners will be able to interact. In terms of functionality, review, star rating, making an appointment with businesses through the app and direct messages between users will be available in the future.
